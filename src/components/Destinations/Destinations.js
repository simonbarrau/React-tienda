        <h3>Gold Coast, Australia</h3>   
                <p>Australia’s 6th largest city, Queensland’s surf Mecca is known for its many right-hand point breaks, long beach breaks and a new artificial reef at Narrowneck. Dry winters, a mild subtropical climate and a massive Hinterland of forested, mountainous national parks make this city of nearly 600,000 a pleasant marriage between the attractions of Australian nature and all the perks and conveniences of a highly developed urban holiday destination. Surfing is best from January to July. Notable breaks include Straddie, Snapper (Superbank), The Spit, Main Beach, Greenmount (Coolangatta beach), Surfers Paradise, Currumbin (The Alley), Burleigh, Miami, Duranbah, Broadbeach and Mermaid Beach, Palm Beach, Tugun, Bilinga and Kirra.</p>

         <h3> Costa Rica </h3>  
         <p> Home to Supertubes, the longest and world’s best right-hander, according to many experts, “Ticos” provides a choice of 10 different sections and is popular with high-level surfers, intermediates and longboarders alike. Be careful of the currents, be sure to wear booties and have a strong board. Besides the pro-level Supertubes.  </p>

         <h3> Bukit Peninsula, Bali, Indonesia   </h3>  
         <p> Eat, pray, surf! An amazing cluster of top-level breaks, the northwest coast of the “Bukit” boasts some of Bali’s best beaches and Asia’s premier surf spots with a selection of waves suitable for all levels from absolute beginner (Padang Padang Right) to expert and pro (Uluwatu, Padang Padang Left). Besides surfing, check out the otherworldly beauty of the Uluwatu temple, which overlooks the world-class surf break of the same name. The Bukit is worth exploring, taking in the gorgeous natural scenery along the coast and finding which break is best for you. Other world-famous surf spots on the Bukit include Bingin, Dreamland, Impossibles and Balangan.  </p>

         <h3> Malibu, California, USA     </h3>  
         <p> The first dedicated World Surfing Reserve, this emblematic corner of Californian culture is famous not only for its waves, but also for appearances in Hollywood films and television series. A great location for beginners and expert surfers alike, Malibu’s proximity to Los Angeles and other SoCal landmarks makes it a perfect surf spot for those in search of a classic adventure on the West Coast of the US. Malibu’s Surfrider Beach is a perfect spot for longboarders and novices, but can be very crowded. In general, California means up to 300 days of fantastic surfing conditions per year. Visiting Malibu is to take pilgrimage to the birth of modern surf culture and the first place surfing took hold outside of its Polynesian birthplace. </p>

         <h3> Oahu, Hawaii, USA  </h3>  
         <p> Here is where we make an exception and name an entire island as one of our top destinations. In truth it would be a crime to leave Oahu out of any surfing-related top 10 list. CNN named Oahu’s Pipeline as the world’s number 1 surf spot, though only experts will be able to ride these legendary 6-meter waves. Fortunately, there are also plenty of other breaks located on the island that is the birthplace of modern surfing. Best for experts during the winter months and beginners during spring, the famous North Shore is 7 miles of spots including Backdoor, Waimea Bay, Ka’ena Point, Sunset Beach, Pupukea Beach and Kahuku Point. Learners can also take advantage of the calmer waves at Waikiki. </p>
